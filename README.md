This repository contains code intended to support the implementation of a lightweight and versatile responsive 
design framework (RDF).  The RDF is written in PHP and consists of a directory structure and development methodology
for delivering dynamically-formatted web content to the user's browser that is based on the browser-type, underlying
OS, and screen resolution.  Using an AJAX-based callback methodology, the RFD provides a straightforward method of 
developing device-adaptive websites for improved user experiences for both conventional and mobile site visitors.
